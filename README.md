# Kings & Generals
Project space for a multi-army chess game

Two chess variants are planned here, both of which feature the armies of western chess, xiangqi (Chinese chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). In order to make the game fair as well as fit these different armies on the same board, different changes will have to be made to "guest" armies. The three armies will be known as ##the Kingdom##, ##the Dynasty##, and ##the Shogugnate##, which are based on chess, xiangqi, and shogi armies, respectively.

The two variants are based on board size and "home" rules:

## Kings & Generals West

Set on an 8 x 8 board, the guest armies of the Dynasty and the Shogunate will have to conform to a western chess asymmmetric board.

## Kings & Generals East

Set on a 9 x 9 board, this board is themed after shogi. And as such, the guest armies of the Kingdom and the Dynasty will gain access to the gamechanging drop rule featured in shogi and crazyhouse variants. This will be developed after K&G-West.

There will be no variant set on the Chinese chess board because it does not accomodate diagonal pieces as well, nor does the restrictions of the palace and river translate well for the other games. Sorry xiangqi fans! However, if anyone has any good ideas, please feel free to add any input!

For more information on each variant, please see their respective pages in their folders.
