# Kings & Generals
Project space for a multi-army chess game

Two chess variants are planned here, both of which feature the armies of western chess, xiangqi (Chinese chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). In order to make the game fair as well as fit these different armies on the same board, different changes will have to be made to "guest" armies. The two variants are based on board size and "home" rules:

## Kings & Generals West

## Kings & Generals East
